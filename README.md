# SHAWN TEST API

## Introduction

The backend should be implemented as a RESTful API using Node. (Try not to use an opinionated framework such as Adonis or Nest).

The backend must include the following endpoints:

 - [POST /api/files] An endpoint that accepts a CSV file upload from the frontend and stores the data in a database or a data structure.
 - [GET /api/users] Should include an endpoint that allows the frontend to search through the loaded CSV data.
 - The search endpoint should accept a ?q= query parameter for search terms and should search through EVERY column of the CSV
 - The backend should include appropriate error handling for invalid requests or other errors.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

## Enviroment Variables

### Local

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

- `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/shawn?schema=public"`

## Running the API

### Local
First you will need to install the dependecies with `npm install` or `yarn`.

Then you can run the PostgreSQL with `docker compose up -d postgres`

With the the postgres running just migrate the database with prisma:

`npx prisma migrate dev`

With the database set up, run the development server with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

## Testing

For running the tests just run `yarn test` or `npm run test`

### Testing with Insomnia

#### Upload csv data
1 - Open Insomnia
2 - Create a request collections
3 - Create a POST HTTP request for the file upload
4 - Change the body type to Multipartform
5 - Name the attribute to file and load the file into the request body

#### Get Users
1 - Open Insomnia
2 - Create a GET HTTP request for the users
3 - Use query params `q` to search in the attributes of a user

## To-Dos

Here is a list of things I would like to do if I have time:

 - [ ] Add better error handling (use middleware for error handling)
 - [ ] Create production dockerfile
 - [ ] Add prettier and eslint
 - [ ] Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
 - [ ] Add sorting and pagination
